Early in his reign, he pushed through a series of well-received reforms and called a zemskii sobor (or \"assembly of the land\"). But -- had an amazingly cruel streak and eventually became unstable: he temporarily abdicated in 1564, killed his favorite son, created a state-within-the-state called the oprichnina to wage war on the boyars, and participated in the torture of his enemies. -- combined the absolutist tendencies of his predecessors with his own violent personality, helping to plunge the country into the subsequent period of civil strife known as the \"Time of Troubles\"."},

Water's high boiling point is due to the high ratio of these bonds to the low molecular mass. For 10 points, name this type of bond resulting from the dipole-dipole force between an electronegative atom and the namesake element bonded to nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine."},
	{term:"hydrogen bond",def:"This phenomenon confers stability to the enol tautomer of beta-keto ketones as well as to dimerized carboxylic acids, while the strongest, symmetric form, occuring at around forty kilocalories per mole, is illustrated by the bifluoride ion. Different numbers of this phenomenon account for why the human genome contains about as many C bases as G bases. Responsible for (*) protein secondary structure like beta sheets, it lowers the volatility of and raises the heat of vaporization of water. For 10 points, name this type of extremely strong dipole-dipole interaction \"accepted\" by nitrogen and oxygen and \"donated\" by its namesake, the lightest element."},
